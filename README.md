## ✨ What is UAP?

UAP (Universal Access Pass) is designed to help you manage digital access with ease. It replaces complicated and fragmented methods of granting access with a simple, shareable pass.

### 🔍 The Problem We Solve

Many people struggle with accessing resources because:

- Proof of access is scattered across different formats.
- It’s often hard to verify credentials.
- Access modes can be easily lost or faked.
- Many current methods are not user-friendly for people with disabilities.
